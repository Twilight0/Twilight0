# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** February 27, 2026

This Privacy Policy explains how your information is handled when you use software developed by **Twilight0**, including **AliveGR** and related projects. 

## 1. Information Collection and Use
We are committed to user privacy. Our software is designed with a **zero-collection** philosophy:

* **No Personal Data:** We do not collect, store, or transmit any personally identifiable information (PII) to any servers under our control. No account registration is required to use the software.
* **No Tracking:** We do not use cookies, web beacons, or any tracking technologies to monitor your behavior or usage patterns.
* **No Analytics:** We do not use third-party analytics SDKs to track application performance or user interactions.

## 2. Third-Party Content and Scraping
Our software functions as a tool to aggregate and present content from various third-party websites. 

* **Direct Connections:** When you access content, the software makes requests directly to third-party servers to scrape and display information. 
* **Third-Party Privacy:** Your interaction with third-party content is governed by the respective privacy policies of those websites. These third parties may receive your IP address and technical headers (such as your User-Agent) as they would if you visited their site through a standard web browser.
* **No Interception:** We do not intercept, modify, or inject data into these third-party requests to identify you.

## 3. Advertisements
Our software is provided free of advertisements. We do not display third-party ads within the interface, nor do we share any data with advertising networks.

## 4. Local Storage
The software may store minimal data locally on your device to function correctly (such as user-defined settings, favorites, or cached content). 

* This data stays on your device.
* We do not have access to this data, and it is never uploaded to our servers.

## 5. Security
Because we do not collect or store user data, there is no database of personal information at risk of compromise. Users who wish to mask their IP address from the third-party websites being scraped are encouraged to use a VPN or proxy service.

## 6. Changes to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our software or legal requirements. The "Last Updated" date at the top of the page will indicate when the latest changes were made.

## 7. Contact
If you have any questions regarding this Privacy Policy or the practices of our software, please contact **Twilight0** through the official project repository or designated community channels.
